        <h3>How to Use Virtual Hour?</h3><br>
        <img src="quickstart.png" alt="Virtual Hour">
        <h5>Faculty View (Professors/TAs)</h5>
        <p><u>Create a Class</u> (you only have to do this once)</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="auth.html?websiteId=create.html">Click create</a> and sign in with your school email.</li>
          <li>Select a class ID. Select the maximum number of TAs for any office hours. Think of this as if each TA uses a desk during OH, then how many desks would you buy?<i> Note: this number does not have to equal the total number of TAs. If a TA
              has
              OH 4-5 pm and another TA has OH 5-6 pm, you only have to buy one desk, here create 1 virtual room.</i> Then enter email addresses of all TAs -- in our analogy, it would be all the TAs who are allowed to use the desks.</i></li>
          <li>"Give Access" to your Google Calendar to create virtual rooms.<i> Note: We do not access any of your calendar events. </i></li>
          <li>Press "Create Virtual Hour". And that's it!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><u>Hold Office Hours</u></p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="index.html">Log in</a> with your school email and your class ID.</li>
          <li>If multiple TAs are helping students simultaneously, TAs should decide their virtual room numbers. <i>Using our analogy, if 3 TAs are holding OH together, they will decide who will have the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd desk.</i></li>
          <li>"Start the Queue". Now, students will be allowed to join the queue.</li>
          <li>Click "Help Next Student" then "Join Meeting Room." Make sure to join your assigned meeting room only - "the desk" you decided with the other TAs you will sit on.</li>
          <li>Students will be automatically asked to join you in your meeting room -- come to your desk. When the student has been helped, click "Help Next Student", "Remove the Student" you just helped, and wait in your meeting room again. <i>Note:
              You will always stay in the same meeting room -- students will come to your "desk".</i></li>
          <li>Repeat until all students have been helped or OH ends. Then "Stop the Queue" and remove all the remaining students from the queue.</i></li>
        </ol>

          <li>Click "Join the Queue" or "See the Queue".</i></li>
          <li>When a TA is available, their conference room's link will appear next to your name. Simply, click on it.</li>
          <li>Need help again? Refresh the page and you will be able to join the queue again.</i></li>
